<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Cybersecurity researchers uncovered two Android spyware campaigns (ProSpy and ToSpy) impersonating Signal and ToTok applications, targeting UAE users via fake websites. Academics demonstrated a hardware-based WireTap attack bypassing Intel SGX security on DDR4 systems, enabling passive decryption of encrypted data. The expiration of the US Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA 2015) risks disrupting federal cyber defense coordination and CISA operations. OpenSSL patched three vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-9230/31/32), including a moderate-severity flaw allowing memory corruption and potential code execution. Broadcom issued critical patches for VMware NSX and vCenter vulnerabilities. Google's Mandiant detailed UNC6040 (ShinyHunters) tactics exploiting Salesforce social engineering for data theft. Chinese APT Phantom Taurus targeted foreign ministries and telcos across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East with espionage operations. Motility Solutions suffered a ransomware attack exposing dealership data, while WestJet disclosed a breach affecting 1.2 million customers’ personal information.</p>
