<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Microsoft released its November 2025 Patch Tuesday updates, addressing over 60 vulnerabilities across its products, including an actively exploited zero-day memory corruption bug, CVE-2025-62215. The updates also include a critical GDI+ component flaw (CVE-2025-60274) and an Office vulnerability (CVE-2025-62199) enabling remote code execution. Additionally, Microsoft issued an out-of-band update (KB5071959) to resolve issues with Windows 10 Extended Security Update (ESU) program enrollment.<br><br><br>Threat actor Dragon Breath has been observed deploying a modified Gh0st RAT using a multi-stage loader named RONINGLOADER.
