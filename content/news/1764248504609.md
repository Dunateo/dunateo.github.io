<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Brian Krebs unmasked "Rey," identified as Saif Al-Din Khader, a 15-year-old from Jordan, as the technical operator and public face of the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters cybercrime group. This group has been involved in data theft and extortion of major corporations, and Khader also launched the ShinySp1d3r ransomware-as-a-service. He is reportedly cooperating with European law enforcement.<br><br>South Korea's financial sector was targeted in a sophisticated supply chain attack that deployed Qilin ransomware. The operation, potentially linked to North Korean state-affiliated actors (Moonstone Sleet), leveraged a Managed Service Provider (MSP) resulting in a "Korean Leaks" data heist affecting 28 victims.<br><br>The Shai-Hulud supply chain attack has escalated, with its second wave spreading from the npm registry to the Maven ecosystem. This campaign has reportedly compromised over 830 packages in npm and exposed thousands of secrets.<br><br>A critical vulnerability was patched in the 'node-forge' package, a widely used JavaScript cryptography library. This flaw allowed for signature verification bypasses through the crafting of seemingly valid data, posing a risk to cryptographic integrity.<br><br>Cyberattackers are increasingly integrating large language models (LLMs) into their malware. This advanced technique allows them to run prompts at runtime, enabling dynamic code augmentation and evasion of detection systems.<br><br>OpenAI disclosed a data breach affecting some ChatGPT API customers due to a compromise at its third-party analytics provider, Mixpanel. Limited identifying information of these customers was exposed.<br><br>Three London councils, including Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, and Hammersmith and Fulham, were hit by a cyberattack, disrupting IT systems and leading to emergency plan activations. The National Crime Agency is involved in the ongoing investigation into potential data compromise.<br><br>The FBI reported that account takeover (ATO) fraud schemes have resulted in over $262 million in losses since January 2025. Cybercriminals impersonate financial institutions to steal data and funds, highlighting a significant financial threat.<br><br>Gainsight announced an expansion of its impacted customer list following a Salesforce security alert. Initially, three customers were identified, but the scale of those affected by suspicious activity targeting Gainsight applications has significantly increased as of November 21, 2025.<br><br>A data breach at Dartmouth College impacted at least 35,000 individuals across multiple states. This incident occurred during a broader campaign by hackers targeting a popular line of Oracle E-Business Suite software.</p>
