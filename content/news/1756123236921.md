<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Washington’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is updating its 2021 SBOM baselines for the Biden administration, tightening the definition of government‑grade BSI for critical software supply chains. <br>Pakistan‑linked APT36, operating under the codename Transparent Tribe, has deployed weaponized Linux .desktop files disguised as PDF documents to deliver a custom ELF RAT into Indian government and defense systems. <br>The payload pulls a hex‑encoded dropper from a domain linked to the threat actor, decodes it, and establishes a command‑and‑control channel to ModGovIndia.space on port 4000 via stealthy DNS/UDP. <br>The campaign was first observed on 1 August 2025 and remains ongoing; it provides the agency with exfiltration capabilities, screenshot capture and webcam recording. <br>The use of BOSS Linux and autostart exploits indicates a tactical shift toward exploiting indigenous operating systems, complementing the group’s existing Windows‑based attacks. <br>These developments signal expanding threat activity against Indian state critical infrastructure and the need for hardened SBOM controls in the U.S. sector.</p>
