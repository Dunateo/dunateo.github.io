<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Germany has summoned Russia’s ambassador following accusations of state-sponsored cyberattacks and a disinformation campaign. The German government provided clear evidence attributing an August 2024 cyberattack on Deutsche Flugsicherung, the country's air traffic control authority, to the Russian military intelligence service GRU, specifically the APT28 (Fancy Bear) group. Furthermore, Russia was accused of running the "Storm 1516" disinformation campaign, active since 2023, to influence Germany’s federal elections and other internal affairs. German authorities indicated that these hybrid threats significantly endanger national security, and coordinated countermeasures are being prepared with EU partners. Russia has previously rejected similar allegations as baseless.</p>
