Unknown attackers utilized this legitimate channel to distribute multi-stage malware to both enterprise and consumer systems.<br><br>A supply chain attack impacted the Open VSX Registry, where threat actors compromised a legitimate developer's account to push malicious updates. On January 30, 2026, four established extensions published under the "oorzc" author were modified to embed GlassWorm malware.<br><br>Millions of personal lease documents in Australia are exposed due to security vulnerabilities found in seven "rent-tech" platforms utilized by real estate agents.
