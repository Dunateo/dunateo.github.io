<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>CISA has added CVE-2025-61757, a critical (CVSS 9.8) Oracle Identity Manager remote code execution flaw, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog due to active exploitation since August 2025; federal agencies must patch by December 12. This vulnerability allows pre-authenticated system takeover. <br><br>Grafana Labs patched CVE-2025-41115, a maximum severity (CVSS 10.0) SCIM flaw in Grafana Enterprise, enabling privilege escalation and user impersonation under specific configurations. <br><br>SolarWinds addressed three critical (CVSS 9.1) remote code execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-40549, -40548, -40547) in its Serv-U file transfer solution. These flaws, exploitable with administrative privileges, require an update to version 15.5.3. <br><br>CrowdStrike confirmed an insider shared internal screenshots with the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters threat group but stated no system breach or customer data exposure occurred. The company terminated the employee involved, with reports indicating an attempt by ShinyHunters to purchase network access. <br><br>A new command-and-control platform, Matrix Push C2, is facilitating fileless, cross-platform phishing by leveraging browser push notifications, fake alerts, and redirects to distribute malicious links across various operating systems. <br><br>Moscow-based Positive Technologies linked the China-aligned APT31 group to cyberattacks targeting entities within Russia's technology sector, indicating ongoing nation-state espionage activities.</p>
