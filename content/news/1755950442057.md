<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Recent reports highlight a surge in inexpensive bot‑net assembly via Redis server exploitation.<br>Attackers target the critical CVE-2024-36401 (CVSS 9.8) to compromise Redis instances worldwide.<br>Exploited servers become hubs for IoT botnets, residential proxy networks, and crypto‑mining farms.<br>The campaigns leverage vulnerabilities in GeoServer, PolarEdge, and Gayfemboy platforms.<br>Security researchers note that the Redis compromises are conducted without users’ awareness.<br>Affected systems typically run default or weak configurations, enabling remote code execution.<br>The bot‑net infrastructure can route large volumes of malicious traffic, masking origin.<br>Command and Control channels are established through compromised Redis servers, encrypted and frequently rotated.<br>Mitigation includes patching CVE-2024-36401, hardening Redis instances, and monitoring anomalous outbound traffic.<br>Cyber‑security teams should audit exposed Redis deployments and enforce strict firewall rules.<br>The latest wave underscores the ease with which existing service software can be weaponised.<br>Proactive defense remains the most effective countermeasure against these rapidly evolving exploits.</p>
