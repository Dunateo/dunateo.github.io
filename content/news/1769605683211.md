<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fortinet has issued emergency updates for FortiOS to address CVE-2026-24858, a critical and actively exploited authentication bypass in FortiCloud SSO, FortiManager, and FortiAnalyzer. The flaw, with a CVSS score of 9.4, was initially mitigated by blocking vulnerable firmware.<br><br>Google warns of active exploitation of WinRAR vulnerability CVE-2025-8088. This high-severity path traversal flaw is being leveraged by nation-state actors and financially motivated groups for initial access and payload delivery in widespread attacks.<br><br>The U.S. CISA added five actively exploited flaws to its KEV catalog, mandating federal agencies to patch by February 16, 2026. These include an Office security bypass (CVE-2026-21509), two SmarterMail flaws (CVE-2026-23760, CVE-2025-52691), a GNU InetUtils telnet daemon vulnerability, and a Linux Kernel integer overflow.<br><br>Security firm Koi revealed "PackageGate," six zero-day vulnerabilities in JavaScript package managers NPM, PNPM, VLT, and Bun.
