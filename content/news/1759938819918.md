<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Chinese-linked threat actors weaponized the open-source Nezha monitoring tool in August 2025, using log poisoning to deliver Gh0st RAT and establish web shells.<br><br>Prominent groups LockBit, Qilin, and DragonForce announced a strategic ransomware alliance, aiming for more effective coordinated attacks.<br><br>A critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-53967, CVSS 7.5) in the Figma-developer-mcp server, a command injection bug from unsanitized user input, has been patched.<br><br>OpenAI disrupted three clusters of Russian, North Korean, and Chinese state-affiliated hackers misusing ChatGPT for malware development, including RATs and credential stealers.<br><br>Vietnamese threat actor BatShadow uses new Go-based "Vampire Bot" malware in social engineering campaigns, targeting job seekers with malicious job descriptions.<br><br>ShinyHunters, a cybercrime group linked to Scattered Spider and Lapsus$, launched a broad corporate extortion spree impacting Salesforce, Red Hat, and Discord. Attacks involved voice phishing for Salesforce data (affecting many Fortune 500 firms), compromising a Red Hat GitLab server, breaching Discord via a third-party vendor, and exploiting a critical Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day (CVE-2025-61882) by Clop in August 2025. Salesforce refuses to pay upcoming ransom demands; law enforcement has made arrests.<br><br>Redis patched a 13-year-old critical RCE flaw (CVE-2025-49844, "RediShell", CVSS 10.0) in its Lua scripting engine. Discovered by Wiz, the use-after-free bug allows authenticated attackers to escape the sandbox and achieve arbitrary code execution, affecting 75% of cloud environments.<br><br>CISA added Synacor Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) zero-day flaw (CVE-2025-27915) to its KEV catalog. Exploited "earlier in 2025" via malicious iCalendar files, this stored XSS enables session hijacking and data exfiltration. Federal agencies must patch by October 28, 2025.<br><br>The Storm-1175 cybercrime group, a Medusa ransomware affiliate, actively exploited a maximum severity GoAnywhere MFT zero-day (CVE-2025-10035) since September 10, 2025. The deserialization flaw allowed remote code execution, RMM tool abuse for persistence, Rclone for exfiltration, and Medusa ransomware deployment.<br><br>The Qilin ransomware gang claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on Japanese brewer Asahi, disrupting operations last week. Asahi has since restarted production.</p>
