<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Nearly 76,000 WatchGuard Firebox network security appliances are publicly exposed and vulnerable to CVE-2025-9242, a critical issue allowing unauthenticated remote code execution. This widespread exposure presents significant risks for organizations. <br><br>CISA warns of active exploitation of a high-severity Windows SMB privilege escalation vulnerability, enabling attackers to gain SYSTEM privileges on unpatched systems. Immediate patching is advised. <br><br>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added five new security flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog, including CVE-2025-61884 in Oracle E-Business Suite, confirming its active exploitation. <br><br>Over 262,000 F5 BIG-IP systems are exposed globally following a nation-state actor breach of F5 in August 2025. The China-linked UNC5221 group stole source code and undisclosed flaws, deploying the Brickstorm backdoor, creating widespread risk. <br><br>A new, ongoing supply-chain attack targets developers on OpenVSX and Microsoft Visual Studio marketplaces. Self-spreading "GlassWorm" malware has been installed approximately 35,800 times, posing a significant threat to development environments. <br><br>China-linked threat group Salt Typhoon is conducting a global cyber-attack campaign. They are exploiting a Citrix flaw and using DLL sideloading techniques to compromise critical infrastructure. <br><br>Japanese retailer Muji has halted online sales, and its logistics partner Askul has stopped online orders and shipments, due to a ransomware attack on Askul. This incident caused significant supply chain disruption. <br><br>Microsoft has revoked over 200 fraudulent code-signing certificates. These were used by the Vanilla Tempest threat group in a ransomware campaign leveraging fake Microsoft Teams installers. <br><br>Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a major outage stemming from DNS resolution issues, causing widespread disruption. Services like Amazon.com, Prime Video, Fortnite, and Perplexity AI were affected, highlighting a critical infrastructure vulnerability. <br><br>Experian Netherlands received a EUR 2.7 million ($3.2 million) fine from the Dutch Data Protection Authority. The penalty addresses multiple GDPR violations, including excessive personal data collection.</p>
