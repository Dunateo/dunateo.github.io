<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Critical vulnerability CVE-2025-49457 in Zoom Windows client and Xerox FreeFlow Core allows privilege escalation and RCE, prompting immediate patch releases. Fortinet’s FortiSIEM suffers a CVE-2025-25256 OS command injection flaw with active exploitation in the wild and a score of 9.8; users must upgrade or limit port 7900. New malvertising campaign PS1Bot distributes modular malware via ads, delivering keylogging, information theft, and persistence. Ransomware group Charon targeted Middle East public sector and aviation, using DLL side‑loading, process injection, and APT‑style evasion. DarkReading reports attackers are exploiting a zero‑day RCE in Erlang/OTP SSH, enabling unauthenticated command execution on OT platforms. Manpower’s systems exposed personal data of ~145,000 users in a breach disclosed on August 13. The U.S. Department of Justice seized $1m in proceeds and domain assets from the BlackSuit ransomware gang. Allianz Life’s Salesforce data breach leaked 2.8 million records, including names, addresses, SSNs and professional details, attributed to the ShinyHunters group. Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday’s office suffered several days of outages after a cyberattack that knocked its phone and email services offline.
