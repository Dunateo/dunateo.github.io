<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A critical pre-authentication RCE (CVE-2025-9242, CVSS 9.3) in WatchGuard Fireware OS's IKEv2 VPN services allows remote arbitrary code execution on Firebox appliances. Researchers achieved root access, noting a lack of modern mitigations. Patches are available for affected versions. <br><br>CISA has added a critical Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) vulnerability (CVE-2025-54253, CVSS 10.0) to its KEV catalog. This zero-day, allowing arbitrary code execution, is under active exploitation, requiring immediate patching. <br><br>F5 disclosed a sophisticated nation-state breach in August 2025, resulting in the theft of BIG-IP source code and undisclosed vulnerability data. F5 released immediate patches, and CISA issued an emergency directive for federal agencies to apply updates by October 22, 2025. <br><br>CISA updated its KEV catalog with new actively exploited flaws: CVE-2016-7836 (SKYSEA RCE), CVE-2025-6264 (Rapid7 Velociraptor command execution), and CVE-2025-47827 (IGEL OS Secure Boot bypass), alongside Windows zero-days. Federal agencies must patch by November 4, 2025. <br><br>"Operation Zero Disco" exploits CVE-2025-20352 (CVSS 7.7), a stack overflow in Cisco IOS/IOS XE Software. Attackers are deploying Linux rootkits on older, unprotected Cisco systems. <br><br>The Qilin ransomware group is expanding operations, announcing new victims globally including government and automotive entities. Resecurity reports Qilin relies on bulletproof hosting and demanded $10 million for data from Asahi Group Holdings. <br><br>A new phishing campaign targets LastPass and Bitwarden users with fake breach alerts, coaxing them to download malicious "secure" desktop apps. This leads to PC hijacks; users are advised to ignore these scams. <br><br>The Chinese-linked "Jewelbug" APT infiltrated a Russian IT service provider for five months (Jan-May 2025). This marks an expansion of the group's cyber espionage, demonstrating long-term, persistent access. <br><br>Research uncovered that over 100 Visual Studio Code extension publishers leaked access tokens, creating a critical software supply chain risk. Attackers could exploit these tokens to push malicious updates to the extensions' entire install base.</p>
