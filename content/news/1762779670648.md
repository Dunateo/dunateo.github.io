<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Three newly disclosed vulnerabilities in the runC container runtime, widely used in Docker and Kubernetes, could allow attackers to bypass isolation restrictions and gain access to the host system. Cybersecurity professionals are urged to address these dangerous flaws, which represent a significant risk to containerized environments.<br><br><br>A large-scale phishing campaign is actively targeting the hospitality industry, luring hotel managers to 'ClickFix-style' credential harvesting pages and deploying PureRAT malware. Attackers are utilizing compromised email accounts to send malicious messages to multiple hotel establishments, posing a threat of data breaches and system compromise.<br><br><br>The U.S. government is reportedly considering a ban on the sale of wireless routers and networking gear from TP-Link Systems due to concerns over its alleged ties to China and national security risks. The company, which maintains it is a U.S. entity with manufacturing in Vietnam, denies any government influence. The proposed ban follows investigations into TP-Link devices found on U.S. military bases and reports from Check Point Research and Microsoft detailing exploitation by Chinese state-sponsored APTs, including 'Camaro Dragon,' for malicious firmware implants and password spraying attacks.<br><br><br>QNAP has released patches for seven zero-day vulnerabilities that were exploited during Pwn2Own Ireland 2025. These critical flaws affect various QNAP software and operating systems, including QTS, QuTS hero, Hyper Data Protector, Malware Remover, and HBS 3 Hybrid Backup Sync. Users are advised to update their devices to the latest versions, such as Hyper Data Protector 2.2.4.1+ and QTS 5.2.7.3297 build 20251024+, to mitigate potential exploitation.</p>
