<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Fortinet warned that CVE-2025-25256, an OS command‑injection flaw in FortiSIEM, is actively exploited in the wild and recommends immediate upgrades to specific versions. <br><br>Researchers observed exploitation attempts against a critical RCE flaw in an Erlang‑based OT platform, a CVSS 10 vulnerability that could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on industrial control systems. <br><br>The critical Erlang/OTP SSH daemon vulnerability (CVE‑2025‑something) has seen a spike in exploitation attempts, allowing unauthenticated command execution on affected systems worldwide. <br><br>The newly discovered Charon ransomware campaign targets Middle East public sector and aviation industries, using DLL side‑loading, process injection, and APT‑level evasion to avoid detection. <br><br>Zoom and Xerox released patches for CVE‑2025‑49457, a privilege escalation bug in Zoom Windows clients, and a remote code execution flaw in Xerox FreeFlow Core, both with CVSS scores above 9.6. <br><br>Microsoft’s August 2025 Patch Tuesday addressed 111 vulnerabilities, including one zero‑day (Kerberos) and 16 critical flaws, updating over 80% of the Windows family and Office applications. <br><br>An urgent patch for the Matrix messaging protocol corrects two high‑severity bugs affecting secure government communications, mitigating potential data‑exfiltration and denial‑of‑service attacks. <br><br>Allianz Life suffered a Salesforce data breach that leaked 2.8 million records, exposing names, addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, and tax IDs to attackers via social engineering. <br><br>Estonian criminals were sentenced to 16 months after U.S. and foreign law‑enforcement seized assets worth over $450 million, including cryptocurrency, vehicles, real estate, and mining equipment.</p>
