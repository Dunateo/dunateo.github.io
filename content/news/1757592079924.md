<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Akira ransomware actors are actively exploiting a SonicWall SSL VPN vulnerability and misconfigurations, per Rapid7, targeting enterprise networks. Threat actors are distributing fake 'Meta Verified' browser extensions via malvertising campaigns, compromising social media business accounts to steal credentials. AsyncRAT malware is being deployed via abused ConnectWise ScreenConnect RMM software, utilizing fileless techniques to exfiltrate sensitive data. Chinese state-linked APT groups employed novel fileless malware 'EggStreme' against Philippine defense contractors, leveraging memory injection for espionage. Three French regional health agencies suffered cyberattacks exposing patient names, contact info, and medical data. UK rail operator LNER confirmed a third-party vendor breach impacting customer data. Brazilian healthcare software provider MedicSolution was hit by KillSec ransomware, threatening patient care operations. Adobe patched a critical Magento/Commerce flaw (CVE-2025-54236) enabling account takeover and RCE via malicious API requests. Security researchers detailed new AsyncRAT campaigns exploiting ScreenConnect access to establish persistence via fake Skype updaters. watchTowr Labs disclosed an unauthenticated RCE chain (CVE-2025-57819) in FreePBX VoIP systems through SQLi and cron job abuse, with active exploitation observed.</p>
