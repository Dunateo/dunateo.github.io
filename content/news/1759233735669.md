<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A new Android banking trojan called Datzbro is targeting elderly users via AI-generated Facebook travel events, enabling device takeover and fraudulent transactions. CISA added five critical vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog, including a Sudo flaw (CVE-2025-32463) under active exploitation in Linux/Unix systems. UK authorities seized £5.5 billion in Bitcoin linked to a Chinese national’s crypto fraud scheme, the largest such seizure recorded. EvilAI malware is distributing malicious code globally by masquerading as AI tools, impacting organizations in Europe, the Americas, and AMEA regions. Japanese brewing giant Asahi suspended domestic operations after a cyberattack disrupted order/shipment systems and customer services. Cybercrime group 'Trinity of Chaos' (Scattered Spider/ShinyHunters) continues attacks on enterprises including Jaguar Land Rover and Marks & Spencer despite claims of disbandment. Dark Reading reported AI voice cloning frameworks enabling real-time vishing attacks to extract sensitive data. Ukrainian threat actors spoofed police authorities using malicious SVG files to deploy Amatera Stealer and PureMiner malware. A critical Sudo vulnerability (CVSS 9.3) allows local privilege escalation on unpatched Linux systems, with CISA mandating federal fixes by October 2025.</p>
