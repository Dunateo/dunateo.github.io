<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Threat intelligence firm GreyNoise observed a 500% spike in scanning activity targeting Palo Alto Networks login portals on October 3, 2025, labeling the traffic as structured reconnaissance. Infoblox exposed threat actor Detour Dog's DNS-powered malware distributing Strela Stealer via the StarFish backdoor, active since August 2023. The Rhadamanthys Stealer upgraded capabilities to include device fingerprinting and PNG steganography, alongside new tools marketed by its operators. The Trinity of Chaos alliance (Lapsus$, Scattered Spider, ShinyHunters) launched a TOR-based leak site with data from 39 companies, including Aeromexico and Cisco, after exploiting Salesforce vulnerabilities, prompting FBI warnings of 1.5B record exposure. Dutch authorities arrested two teens for alleged pro-Russian espionage, part of hybrid attacks against Europe per Prime Minister Dick Schoof. Cisco Talos identified a Chinese-speaking group hijacking IIS servers for SEO fraud campaigns. Oracle traced an extortion campaign to vulnerabilities patched in July 2025, linked to Clop ransomware affiliates. Jaguar Land Rover faced severe operational and financial repercussions after incomplete remediation of a prior breach led to renewed ransomware attacks.</p>
