<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 identified TGR-STA-1030, an Asian state-backed cyber espionage group, breaching 70 government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 countries over the past year. They also conducted active reconnaissance against 155 government infrastructures.<br><br>A Mysterium VPN study found nearly 5 million public web servers exposing Git repository metadata, with 250,000 leaking active deployment credentials via `.git/config` files. This widespread misconfiguration in regions like the US, Germany, and France, enables code theft and credential abuse.<br><br>CISA added CVE-2025-11953 (React Native CLI OS Command Injection, "Metro4Shell" actively deploying Rust malware) and CVE-2026-24423 (critical unauthenticated RCE in SmarterTools SmarterMail < build 9511) to its KEV catalog, with a Feb 26, 2026, deadline.<br><br>Cybersecurity researchers reported a supply chain attack on npm and PyPI, compromising legitimate packages like `@dydxprotocol/v4-client-js`. Malicious versions were pushed for wallet credential theft and remote code execution, posing a significant risk to developers and crypto users.<br><br>A critical command injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-6978) in Arista NG Firewall allows remote, authenticated root RCE. Fixed in version 17.4+, it stems from improper user data validation in the `runTroubleshooting()` method.<br><br>The AISURU/Kimwolf DDoS botnet launched a record-setting HTTP DDoS attack, peaking at 31.4 Terabits per second (Tbps) for 35 seconds. Cloudflare detected and mitigated this hyper-volumetric event, part of a Q4 2025 trend.<br><br>Anthropic's new LLM, Claude Opus 4.6, discovered over 500 previously unknown high-severity security flaws in open-source libraries (e.g., Ghostscript, OpenSC, CGIF). This demonstrates AI's growing role and enhanced capabilities in proactive vulnerability discovery.<br><br>Conpet, Romania's national oil pipeline operator, confirmed a cyberattack disrupting its technology infrastructure and website. While oil transport remained unaffected, hackers claimed data theft, highlighting persistent threats to critical national infrastructure.<br><br>Spain's Ministry of Science partially shut down its IT systems following data breach claims. The disruption impacts several citizen- and company-facing services, indicating a significant cyber incident affecting government operations.<br><br>Ransomware operators are abusing ISPsystem virtual machines (VMs) for stealthy, at-scale hosting and delivery of malicious payloads. This tactic complicates detection and mitigation efforts for organizations, presenting new challenges in defending against ransomware.</p>
