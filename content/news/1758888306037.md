The UK NCSC confirmed Cisco ASA firewalls were compromised via zero-days (CVE-2025-20333/CVE-2025-20362) to deploy RayInitiator and LINE VIPER malware, prompting CISA to issue an emergency directive for federal agencies to mitigate by September 26. Salesforce patched a critical AI Agentforce vulnerability (CVSS 9.4) allowing CRM data theft via indirect prompt injection. Microsoft reported a macOS XCSSET malware variant targeting Firefox with enhanced encryption and clipboard hijacking. Vane Viper's infrastructure generated 1 trillion DNS queries to support global malvertising and ad fraud. Chinese APT UNC5221 deployed new Brickstorm backdoor variants on network edge devices lacking EDR protection. A LockBit ransomware variant with cross-platform capabilities emerged as its most dangerous iteration. Interpol's Operation Contender 3.0 led to 260 arrests targeting African BEC and romance scam networks.
