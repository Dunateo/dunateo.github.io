Observed in January 2026, the group targets NGOs and individuals documenting human rights abuses, coinciding with recent unrest in Iran.<br><br>Concerns are rising over OpenClaw (ClawdBot/MoltBot), a popular open-source AI assistant. Its rapid adoption in business environments and autonomous control capabilities within user computers present new security risks.<br><br>CrowdStrike reports that the North Korean hacking group Labyrinth Chollima has splintered into two additional threat actor groups. This suggests a reorganization of North Korean state-sponsored cyber operations, potentially diversifying attack campaigns.<br><br>CERT Polska detailed coordinated cyberattacks on December 29, 2025, against over 30 wind/solar farms, a manufacturer, and a major CHP plant in Poland.
