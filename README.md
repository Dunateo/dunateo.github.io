# Static Website with Zola

This project is a static website generated with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), using the archie-zola theme.

Project serves as my personal website, designed to offer a straightforward platform for sharing my insights and experiences as I navigate through the field of computer science. 

The website itself illustrates this learning process, featuring an automated build and deployment system. 

Using GitHub Actions, the site is automatically rebuilt and published to GitHub Pages after each commit, demonstrating practical application of continuous integration and deployment techniques.
