<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>NationStates, a multiplayer browser-based game, confirmed a data breach and subsequently shut down its website to investigate the security incident.

A threat actor is demanding low ransoms from affected owners for the recovery of their compromised data.<br><br>The update infrastructure of eScan antivirus, developed by MicroWorld Technologies, suffered a compromise. Unknown attackers utilized this legitimate channel to distribute multi-stage malware to both enterprise and consumer systems.<br><br>A supply chain attack impacted the Open VSX Registry, where threat actors compromised a legitimate developer's account to push malicious updates. On January 30, 2026, four established extensions published under the "oorzc" author were modified to embed GlassWorm malware.<br><br>Millions of personal lease documents in Australia are exposed due to security vulnerabilities found in seven "rent-tech" platforms utilized by real estate agents. A researcher's analysis highlighted that sensitive information from renters and landlords was accessible via online hyperlinks.<br><br>The Russia-linked Fancy Bear hacking group is actively exploiting a new, undisclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Office. CERT-UA has confirmed these cyber-attacks are targeting organizations in Ukraine and the European Union.<br><br>Bitdefender researchers have identified a novel Android malware campaign that utilizes the legitimate artificial intelligence platform Hugging Face for hosting its RAT payload. This method potentially helps the malware evade detection.<br><br>Nation-state attackers successfully hijacked the Notepad++ application's update system by compromising the hosting provider's infrastructure.
