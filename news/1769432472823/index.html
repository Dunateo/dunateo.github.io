<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a warning regarding a critical VMware vCenter Server remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability that is now being actively exploited. U.S. federal agencies have been mandated to patch their affected servers within a three-week timeframe to mitigate the threat. <br><br>1Password, a digital vault and password manager, has enhanced its security features by incorporating built-in protection against phishing URLs. The new functionality provides users with pop-up warnings when navigating to suspected malicious websites, aiming to prevent credential compromise by threat actors. <br><br>Google's Threat Intelligence Group has highlighted the growing sophistication of AI-based attacks, noting adversaries leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to conceal code and generate malicious scripts in real-time. This allows malware to rapidly adapt and evade detection, underscoring the necessity of a combined defensive strategy to counter these evolving threats. <br><br>The U.S. law firm Hagens Berman is initiating a class action lawsuit against Coupang, alleging security failures that contributed to a data breach in June 2025. The firm is investigating the extent of the impact and potential liabilities stemming from the incident. <br><br>Okta has detected sophisticated, customized, and reactive vishing attacks designed to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA). Threat actors impersonate IT support teams and employ phishing kits to dynamically generate fake login pages in real-time, tricking victims into divulging their credentials. <br><br>Check Point Research has detailed an active phishing campaign by the North Korea-linked KONNI APT group, which is now deploying AI-generated PowerShell malware. This campaign specifically targets blockchain developers and engineering teams across Japan, Australia, and India, utilizing Discord-hosted ZIP files with LNK and PDF lures to initiate an infection chain that deploys a stealthy, AI-assisted backdoor. <br><br>ESET has attributed a destructive cyberattack attempt on Poland's energy sector on December 29, 2025, to the Russia-linked Sandworm APT group. The incident involved the deployment of a wiper malware, identified as DynoWiper (Win32/KillFiles.NMO), which showed clear destructive intent. While no successful disruption of the power grid was confirmed, the attack coincided with the tenth anniversary of Sandworm's 2015 cyberattack on Ukraine's power grid.</p>
