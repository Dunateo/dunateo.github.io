<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Trust Wallet issued an urgent advisory to update its Chrome extension after a security incident on December 24 led to the loss of approximately $7 million in cryptocurrency. The compromise, affecting version 2.68 and impacting around one million users, was linked to malicious code within the extension. Security researchers also noted the appearance of a related phishing domain in connection with the incident.<br><br>A China-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) group, identified as Evasive Panda, has been observed conducting a cyber espionage campaign utilizing DNS poisoning to deploy its MgBot backdoor. The highly targeted attacks, which occurred between November 2022 and November 2024, primarily focused on victims in Türkiye, China, and India. This activity marks a notable instance of sophisticated state-sponsored cyber espionage.<br><br>The pro-Russian hacking group Noname057 has claimed responsibility for a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that disrupted the French national postal service, La Poste, and its associated digital banking and online services. The incident affected La Poste's main website, mobile application, digital identity service, and the Digiposte document storage platform. French intelligence agency DGSI has taken over the investigation into the attack.<br><br>Grigol Liluashvili, who served as the head of the Republic of Georgia's state security service from 2020 until April of this year, has been arrested. He faces allegations of protecting scam call centers that engaged in fraudulent activities, defrauding victims globally. This marks a significant law enforcement action against alleged high-level corruption facilitating international cybercrime.</p>
